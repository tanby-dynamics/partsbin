This is a mix of small features, improvements, and bug fixes.

- Close navigation when selecting a link
- Close navigation on search
- Display version in navigation
- Disable cancelling the add part modal when clicking outside the modal (this was resulting in data loss when editing the part)
- Loosen up search to make it work a bit more reliably
- Add link to Google part numbers
- View by part number
- Allow searching for part numbers when adding or editing a part
- Update part view when the quantity is changed
