# Automated build setup

Note that this is only needed for the maintainer (@becdetat) to build and publish the ARM64 image.

For the ARM64 build to work, there needs to be a worker running.

```
cd ~/development/becdetat/partsbin-action-runner
./run.sh
```

Leave the runner running until you're finished doing releases.
